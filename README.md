The point of this repository is alleviate my loneliness while I'm writing C/C++ code. Because I got stressed when working with myself sometimes and sharing stuff kinda relaxes me and yeah that's it. Don't expect from me to provide you huge super scaleable ++ ultra mega super code in this repo. Anyways... :P You can go now... There is nothing to see here...
